# MiniNodo
node version of MiniNero's simpleserver.py 
This is like a backend for a MiniNero win 10 gui which will be posted shortly.
(The previous back-end is in python, and works also). 

Note: Change the variable "dummy" in routes/routes.js to false (i.e. dummy=false) when you are done testing and want it to actually send money
