# MiniNodo
node version of MiniNero's simpleserver.py 
This is like a backend for a MiniNero win 10 gui which will be posted shortly.
(The previous back-end is in python, and works also). 

Note: Change the variable "dummy" in routes/routes.js to false at your own risk! (this will enable actual Monero usage).
